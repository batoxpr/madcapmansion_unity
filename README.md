# MadCap Mansion - Project Description

**MadCap Mansion** is a narrative-driven visual novel that immerses players in a mysterious and suspenseful adventure within a haunted mansion. The overarching theme of the game revolves around mystery, the testing of friendships, and confronting fears—elements that are deeply woven into the fabric of the gameplay.

## Theme Interpretation

Our interpretation of this theme manifests through the game's central setting—a haunted mansion filled with secrets and supernatural elements. This setting acts as a metaphor for the unknown challenges and fears individuals face in their lives. Players navigate through this enigmatic environment, making choices that not only determine the course of the story but also test the strength and reliability of the friendships between the characters.

The game system is designed to convey this theme by allowing players to interact with the environment and other characters through a series of choices that influence the narrative's direction. These choices mimic real-life decisions where outcomes are uncertain and repercussions are significant. This mechanic encourages players to consider their actions carefully, mirroring the real-world importance of trust and decision-making in relationships.

The integration of multiple endings based on player decisions reinforces the theme by showing how different choices lead to different resolutions, further emphasizing the game's underlying message about the consequences of one's actions and the unpredictability of life when faced with the unknown.

## Process and Implementation

Our journey with MadCap Mansion began with laying down the narrative framework using Twine. This step was crucial because it allowed us to map out the entire story with all its branches and twists before diving into any complex coding or design in Unity. Building the game in Twine first helped us see how each decision would flow into the next and identify any gaps or inconsistencies early on. We made sure that the plot was engaging and solid because we believe that a good game needs a strong story at its heart, more than just fancy graphics.

Moving our project from Twine to Unity was a huge step up in complexity. Unity allowed us to bring in interactive elements like character movement, sound effects, and a visually rich environment. Here, our professor’s advice was invaluable. They helped us understand Unity’s capabilities and how to use them effectively to make our game come alive. But even with their help, we had to put in a lot of effort to learn the ropes ourselves. We spent many nights going through Unity tutorials, participating in forums, and troubleshooting issues to ensure we could implement our vision accurately.

When it came to design, we aimed to keep things simple so that the players could focus on the story and their choices. The interface was designed to be clean and user-friendly, avoiding any unnecessary distractions from the narrative. Each player action was designed to have a significant impact on the game's progression, which meant we had to think carefully about how to build these decision points and their consequences within the game.

As beginners in game development, one of our most significant challenges was integrating the visual and gameplay elements effectively. We were determined to make MadCap Mansion visually appealing without sacrificing the depth of the gameplay. We’re all proud of how we managed to strike this balance, as it involved a steep learning curve and a collaborative effort from the entire team.

We chose a visual style that enhances the mysterious and eerie vibe of the game. Working through Unity, we learned how to animate characters, incorporate interactive objects, and embed audio cues that complement the gameplay. For instance, we included various interactive elements like a phone that the player can use to uncover clues, and environmental objects like spiders that add to the creepy atmosphere. Each visual and sound effect was thoughtfully placed to build tension and guide the player through the story, making the gameplay experience immersive and engaging.

Despite being beginners, we’re very proud of what we’ve accomplished. Every team member poured their effort into learning new tools and techniques to bring our vision to life. The features we incorporated, like the option for players to choose different paths in the game, move characters, and interact with a variety of objects, all contribute to a rich and engaging player experience that we hope will be as rewarding to play as it was to create
Finalizing the game space involved a lot of refining and testing to get everything just right. Each room of the mansion was crafted to not only look distinct but also fit seamlessly into the story’s atmosphere. We included subtle hints and foreshadows through visual elements and dialogue, enhancing the mystery and engaging players deeper into the game’s world.

Throughout this process, we learned a lot about balancing narrative depth with interactive gameplay. The feedback from our professor and extensive testing helped us polish the game to meet our vision of a cohesive and immersive experience.

## Playtest Assessment

During the playtesting phase of MadCap Mansion, we gathered critical insights that significantly influenced the refinement of our game. Early feedback from our initial sessions highlighted the need for clearer dialogue and more intuitive navigation cues, prompting us to make several vital adjustments. For example, to enhance accessibility, especially for visually impaired players, we implemented AI-driven text-to-speech technology. This allowed the dialogue and narrative cues to be more inclusive, helping all players enjoy the story.

One of the main pieces of feedback from a guest speaker was about the visual representation of characters and settings. They suggested that adding detailed visuals for characters and more defined backgrounds would greatly enrich the player's immersion in the game world. Taking this advice, we worked on incorporating distinct and engaging graphics for each character and developed more intricate and atmospheric backgrounds for the various rooms of the mansion.
Another piece of feedback from the professor was to enlargen the text and pkay around with the colors. We took that into consideration as we all agreed and made the necessary changes. The enhancements in character visuals and backgrounds not only improved the aesthetic appeal but also helped players connect more deeply with the story and characters. 

After presenting to the class we have also adjusted the colors and sprites to the best of our ability.

## Reflection and Evaluation

The development process of MadCap Mansion was both a significant challenge and a learning experience for the team. Initially, our expectations were quite modest; we aimed to create a game that we ourselves would enjoy, despite our varied gaming preferences. We settled on a visual novel format because it uniquely combined elements of choice-driven narratives with conclusive storytelling, appealing to all our tastes.

Entering into this project, our expectations for successfully implementing the game were tempered by our limited experience with Unity and the complexity of what we wanted to achieve. While we had worked with Unity in class, adapting our skills to this new challenge was a steep learning curve. We previosuly did shooter and FPS games which are very different to a visual novel; howver, we were ready to tackle this challenge, though uncertain of the outcome.

Surprisingly, we exceeded many of our own expectations and met several key goals. The feedback from playtesting was immensely helpful and showed that our focus on crafting a cohesive and intriguing story with multiple outcomes was successful. Players found the dialogue and settings relatable and immersive, which was particularly rewarding given our goal to create a game that resonated with themes relevant to our age group.

However, there were aspects we wished we could have implemented if time and skills had permitted. For instance, adding our own voiceovers or custom artwork could have personalized the game more and enhanced the immersion. We also contemplated making the game more tailored to our NYUAD community, adding local flavors and contexts to increase relevance and engagement. Unfortunately, these elements were sidelined in favor of focusing on the core narrative and ensuring the game maintained its eerie and mysterious atmosphere.

Despite these compromises, the project was a success in many ways. We managed to create a game that not only entertained but also offered a deep, interactive storytelling experience, allowing players to influence the narrative through their choices. This achievement has been a source of pride for our team and has significantly enriched our understanding and appreciation of game development.

## Game as Meaningful Play

The game explores the theme of mystery and suspense, set against the backdrop of a haunted mansion, which serves as a metaphor for the unknown challenges and unpredictable nature of life. The mansion, with its eerie corridors and hidden secrets, mirrors the complexities and uncertainties that we often encounter in our personal journeys.

A central metaphor in our game design was the testing of relationships under stress. The gameplay mechanics, such as choosing whom to trust, making decisions that affect the group, and facing the consequences of those choices, are designed to reflect real-life scenarios where friendships and loyalties are tested. This aspect of the game was developed with the intention of provoking players to think about the value of trust and support when navigating challenging situations.

Additionally, the haunted mansion itself is a metaphor for confronting fears and the past. Just as characters in the game must explore this daunting environment and uncover its mysteries, players are invited to confront their own fears and learn from the secrets they uncover. This parallel adds a layer of depth to the gameplay, making the experience both thrilling and thought-provoking.

Another hidden metaphor, was the capital letters spelling the most ideal solution throughout the game. This goes to show that sometimes what we are loking for is right under our nose but we get too distracted by life, friendhsips and the drama of it all that we do not pay attention to the little things that could end up solving our issues.

Playtest feedback indicated that these metaphors resonated well with players, aligning closely with our original intentions. Players appreciated the depth of the narrative and how their choices significantly impacted the game's outcome, echoing real-life decisions and their sometimes unforeseen consequences. The feedback also revealed that the haunting atmosphere of the mansion effectively amplified the suspense and emotional intensity of the game, enhancing the overall thematic expression. Additonally, only a small number of our friends and family that playetsted even questioned the random capital letter as most assumed it is a typo.

While the metaphors and themes we chose were ambitious, the playtest sessions confirmed that they contributed meaningfully to the gameplay experience. Players engaged deeply with the narrative, often discussing how the scenarios made them reflect on their personal experiences and relationships. This alignment between our game's design and the players' reception highlights MadCap Mansion as a successful instance of meaningful play, where entertainment and reflection go hand in hand.
